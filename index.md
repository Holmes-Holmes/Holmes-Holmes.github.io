            *Framework of Holmes*

Software composition analysis (SCA) tools have been widely adopted to identify vulnerable libraries used in software applications. Such SCA tools depend on a vulnerability database to know affected libraries of each vulnerability. However, it is labor-intensive and error-prone for a security team to manually maintain the vulnerability database. While
several approaches adopt extreme multi-label learning to predict affected libraries for vulnerabilities, they are practically ineffective due to the limited library labels and the unawareness of ecosystems. To address these problems, we first conduct an empirical study to assess the quality of two fields, i.e., affected libraries and their ecosystems, for four vulnerability databases. Our study reveals notable inconsistency and inaccuracy in these two fields. Then, we propose
Holmes to identify affected libraries and their ecosystems for vulnerabilities via a learning-to-rank technique. The key idea of Holmes is to gather various evidences about affected libraries and their ecosystems from multiple sources, and learn to rank a pool of libraries based on their relevance to evidences. Our extensive experiments haveshown the effectiveness, efficiency and usefulness of Holmes.

# Dataset

* large scale dataset
    > [Complete dataset mentioned in Sec 3.1(Vulnerability Database Selection)](Holmes/Empirical_Study/component_ana_log/tmp_component.json) (you should unzip the component_ana_log.zip file first)
* GroundTruth
    > [Ground Truth](Holmes/GroundTruth/pypimavennpmgo_component_tagging_2023_0720_wss.xlsx)

# Setup

## Holmes Setup
We achieve Holmes in [Holmes](Holmes/ApproachImp), you can replicate our result with the guide of [How to start](Holmes/ApproachImp/README.md). If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to let us know.

## Other Tools Setup
The hyper parameters that result in FastXML's ,LightXMLâ€™s, ZestXML's best performance mentioned in previous work were used. You can start with the [FastXML](https://github.com/soarsmu/ICPC_2022_Automated-Identification-of-Libraries-from-Vulnerability-Data-Can-We-Do-Better/tree/master#FastXML), [LightXML](https://github.com/soarsmu/ICPC_2022_Automated-Identification-of-Libraries-from-Vulnerability-Data-Can-We-Do-Better/tree/master#LightXML), [Chronos](https://github.com/soarsmu/Chronos). 

By the way, when reproducing these works, we have added detailed annotations to [the code along with the trained and tested data](Holmes/Setup) used for the reproduction. Additionally, we have provided a [README](Holmes/Setup/README.md) to assist you in avoiding common pitfalls while reproducing these three projects.








# Experiment
The evaluation contains RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, RQ4, RQ5, RQ6 and RQ7

The RQ3, RQ4 and RQ6 are uploaded to [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/holmesholmes/holmes-experiment), after unzip all file, you can easily replicat the result on our paper.

## RQ1 Consistency Assessment
